Use Elementor to design your complete website. Reuse header/footer on all pages. No theme required.

== Description ==

This nifty plugin turns the Elementor Page Builder into a Full Site Editor.

You can design your entire website layout (header, footer, sidebars, etc..) and apply that layout to every page of your website.

Update the layout once and it applies to every page automatically.
